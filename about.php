                    <p>This project is an ongoing collaboration. </p>

                    <p>I am searching for other talented musicians for help in finishing the material
                        (primarily vocalists who can write as well). If you hear anything you like, especially if you
                        are a vocalist, <a href="contact.php">send me a copy of your demo</a> and let's see if we can
                        make
                        some music.</p>

                <h4 class="text-pink">My History</h4>
                <p>My history is in the recording business. I play guitar and keyboards, engineer, and produce
                    bands.</p>

                <p>I owned and operated a recording studio between 1990 and 1996 in Seattle called the <a
                        href="http://houseofleisure.net" target="_blank"> House of Leisure</a>. Recording mostly rock
                    bands located here in Seattle, we enjoyed working with first time
                    recording artists to world class musicians. We also hosted artist showcases featuring local bands
                    and performers. Now finally I am able to spend time finishing on my own music.</p>

                <p>As a recording studio, our short list of clients include Hater (SubPop), Hater the 2nd (Barsuk
                    Records), Soundgarden (A&M Records), Gruntruck (Roadrunner Records), Sony Records, CZ Records,
                    Loosegroove, Suction, Tad and many others.
